# Storage

A storage module connects Wiki.js with a local or remote storage provider, to act as backup or source of truth for content. It consists of properties that can be set by the user as well as methods that are called on certain events, such as to create, update and delete content.

Storage modules are located in `/server/modules/storage`.

A unique folder is created for each module. The folder contains two files:

* **definition.yml**
* **storage.js**

## definition.yml

This file contains information about your module.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="definition.yml" %}
```yaml
key: example
title: Example Storage
author: John Doe
props:
  firstExampleProperty: String
  secondExampleProperty: Number
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

### Properties

* **key**: A short, unique and camelCase-formatted name for this module. It must match exactly the module folder name!
* **title**: The full name of the module.
* **author**: The name of the author of the module.
* **props**: An object of user editable properties. See [Module Properties](properties.md) for more info.

## storage.js

This file contains methods that will be called when a new page is created, modified, deleted, etc.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="storage.js" %}
```javascript
module.exports = {
  async activated () {
​
  },
  async deactivated () {
​
  },
  async init () {
  
  },
  async created () {
​
  },
  async updated () {
​
  },
  async deleted () {
​
  },
  async renamed () {
​
  }
}
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

All methods are required and must be implemented.

### activated

Upon activation of the storage module from the administration area. This is usually where storage prerequisites are checked _\(e.g. check settings, try to connect, create container, initialize repository, etc.\)._ 

```javascript
async activated () { }
```

Use **this.config** inside the method to access the configuration of the storage strategy. For example, if you defined properties `clientId` and `clientSecret` for the module props, `this.config` will be an object with properties `clientId` and `clientSecret` containing the values entered by the user in the administration area.

Any error thrown \(or returning a rejected promise\) will be reported to the user and the storage strategy will not be enabled.

### deactivated

Upon deactivation of the storage module from the administration area. This is where you disconnect from the storage provider if required. You should **never delete any content** upon deactivation, as the user may choose to re-enable this storage strategy later or simply want to keep the current content as backup.

```javascript
async deactivated (opts) { }
```

**this.config** is an object containing the configuration of the storage strategy. See the [activated](storage.md#activated) event for more details.

Any error thrown \(or returning a rejected promise\) will be reported to the user and the storage strategy will not be disabled.

### init

Upon initialization of Wiki.js \(both startups or restarts\) and directly after the `activated` event. This is useful to establish a connection in some storage strategies.

```javascript
async init (opts) { }
```

**this.config** is an object containing the configuration of the storage strategy. See the [activated](storage.md#activated) event for more details.

Any error thrown \(or returning a rejected promise\) will prevent the storage strategy from being used until Wiki.js is restarted or the error is acknowledged by the user in the administration area.

### created

Upon creation of a new page.

```javascript
async created (opts) { }
```

Use **this** context inside the method to access following properties:

```javascript
{
    config: Object, // Object containing the storage configuration
    mode: String, // Sync mode (push, pull or sync)
    page: {
        id: Number, // Unique ID of the page
        locale: String, // 2 letter code (e.g. en). Empty if locale disabled
        path: String, // Unique path of the page (e.g. some/page)
        title: String, // Title of the page
        description: String, // Short description of the page
        isPrivate: Boolean, // Is the page inside the user private namespace
        isPublished: Boolean, // Is the page published
        publishStartDate: String, // ISO-8601 Date (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ)
        publishEndDate: String, // ISO-8601 Date (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ)
        contentType: String, // The content original type (e.g. markdown, html, etc.)
        content: String, // The content
        createdAt: String, // ISO-8601 Date (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ)
        authorId: Number, // The Unique ID of the author
        authorName: String, // The full name of the author
        authorEmail: String // The email address of the author
    }
}
```

Any error thrown \(or returning a rejected promise\) will be logged but will not prevent the page from being created internally.

### updated

Upon modification of a page contents.

```javascript
async updated (opts) { }
```

Use **this** context inside the method to access following properties:

```javascript
{
    id: Number, // Unique ID of the page
    locale: String, // 2 letter code (e.g. en). Empty if locale disabled
    path: String, // Unique path of the page (e.g. some/page)
    title: String, // Title of the page
    description: String, // Short description of the page
    isPrivate: Boolean, // Is the page inside the user private namespace
    isPublished: Boolean, // Is the page published
    publishStartDate: String, // ISO-8601 Date (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ)
    publishEndDate: String, // ISO-8601 Date (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ)
    contentType: String, // The content original type (e.g. markdown, html, etc.)
    content: String, // The content
    createdAt: String, // ISO-8601 Date (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ)
    updatedAt: String, // ISO-8601 Date (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ)
    authorId: Number, // The Unique ID of the author (user updating the page)
    authorName: String, // The full name of the author (user updating the page)
    authorEmail: String, // The email address of the author (user updating the page)
    creatorId: Number, // The Unique ID of the user that first created the page
    creatorName: String, // The full name of the user that first created the page
    creatorEmail: String // The email address of the user that first created the page
}
```

Any error thrown \(or returning a rejected promise\) will be logged but will not prevent the page from being updated internally.

### deleted

Upon deletion of a page.

```javascript
async deleted (opts) { }
```

Use **this** context inside the method to access following properties:

```javascript
{
    id: Number, // Unique ID of the page
    locale: String, // 2 letter code (e.g. en). Empty if locale disabled
    path: String, // Unique path of the page (e.g. some/page)
    title: String, // Title of the page
    description: String, // Short description of the page
    isPrivate: Boolean, // Is the page inside the user private namespace
    createdAt: String, // ISO-8601 Date (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ)
    deletedAt: String, // ISO-8601 Date (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ)
    authorId: Number, // The Unique ID of the author (user deleting the page)
    authorName: String, // The full name of the author (user deleting the page)
    authorEmail: String, // The email address of the author (user deleting the page)
    creatorId: Number, // The Unique ID of the user that first created the page
    creatorName: String, // The full name of the user that first created the page
    creatorEmail: String // The email address of the user that first created the page
}
```

Any error thrown \(or returning a rejected promise\) will be logged but will not prevent the page from being deleted internally.

Upon rename of a page or when a page is moved to another location.

```javascript
async renamed (opts) { }
```

Use **this** context inside the method to access following properties:

```javascript
{
    id: Number, // Unique ID of the page
    locale: String, // 2 letter code (e.g. en). Empty if locale disabled
    sourcePath: String, // Previous path of the page (e.g. some/oldpage)
